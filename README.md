<h1>CEO Turnover Index</h1>
<p>
  I have spent over four years in the Executive Search industry with a focus on executive leadership. More specifically on Chief Executive Officers (or, CEOs). 

The CEOs of large, global public listed companies move in an almost Brownian Motion-like fashion; one that reflects broader global macroeconomic and social trends over time. 

My fascination with this subject inspired me to build a Tableau dashboard which tracks CEO ‘churn’ in the 1732 constituent companies of 11 major global market indices across the world.
